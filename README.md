## Projects

**Tech:** Python, Excel

This project was made for my mom. She works as a volunteer at my brothers school and one of her main jobs is to handle the yearly raffle. In this position she is tasked with reading through a weekly spreadsheet contaning raffle sales data from hundreds of students. This was a process which took hours out of her week every week so I looked to automate the process. I created a Python script which takes in the spreadsheet and automatically tallies the students and their personal sales totals. This program had to ensure efficency as well as 100% accuracy. I implemented fuxxy matching as well as a formattng algorithm and a dynamic database for nicknames in order to ensure perfect accuracy. After two years of use it has processed over $500,000 in sales data and saves my mom an average of 4-6 hours of work a week.
