## Andrew Bevington

Hello! My name is Andrew Bevington. I am a current senior at Boston College studying Computer Science. Below is a quick overview of the projects publicly available in my GitHub repo. 

## Projects

**Tech:** Python, Excel

This project was made for my mom who volunteers at my brother's school managing their yearly raffle. She spent hours each week manually processing spreadsheets containing sales data from hundreds of students. To automate this tedious task, I developed a Python script that efficiently processes the weekly spreadsheets and automatically tallies student sales totals. The implementation includes fuzzy matching algorithms, custom formatting protocols, and a dynamic nickname database to ensure 100% accuracy in student identification. After two years of deployment, the program has successfully processed over $500,000 in sales data and saves my mom 4-6 hours of work weekly.

**Tech:** Python, PyTorch, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Generative AI

This served as the capstone project for my college course Biomedial Image Analysis which I worked on with two other teammates. This project leverages deep learning architectures including VDVAE (Very Deep Variational Autoencoder) and Versatile Diffusion models to take in fMRI scans and reconstruct the image that a patient was viewing at the time of the scan. Built with PyTorch and using AWS for data processing, we implemented both Ridge Regression and SGD-based approaches for feature extraction, with optimizations for memory-efficient processing of high-dimensional neuroimaging data. The pipeline successfully demonstrates efficent conversions between brain scans and reconstructed images, contributing to advances in neural decoding and brain-computer interface development for less computationally competent machines.

[![Teacher-Database](https://img.shields.io/badge/Teacher_Database-darkorchid?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/SawyerMaloney/hth)

**Tech:** Python, MongoDB

This project served as my entry to the 2023 24-hour hackathon at Boston College. Along with one other teammate, we created a scalable and synchronous database. Leveraging Python as the backend and MongoDB as the database we created a place for teachers to upload, download, and comment on documents categorized both by grade level as well as subject. We aimed to improve the teacher experience by allowing something like a 3rd grade math teacher in Montana to upload worksheets she created which another teacher may download and use in her own class saving hours of work and making an increcibly stressful job a little easier and more collaborative. Our project won the MongoDB award for "Best Database Implementation".

Outside of coding I love to make things. I do a fair bit of woodworking and cobbling, having created multiple shoes completely from scratch leather. I also hike when I can and have picked up a habit of biking almost everywhere I want to go. Thank you for taking the time to read this all and please reach out to bevingtonan@gmail.com if you have any questions
